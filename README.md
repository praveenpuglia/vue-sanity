# vue-sanity
Situations I encounter with Vue which are worth documenting.

## How to?
Go to [issues](../../issues) and search for the issue you are looking for. If it's in closed, it's answered. If it's not, it's open and you can add an answer or we can discuss multiple answers.

## Contribute
If you face specific, small problem and want to document it, create an issue, explain the problem and the answer too. Even if you think it's silly, it's not.
